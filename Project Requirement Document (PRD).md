# 1. Introduction & Overview

## 1.1 Problem Statement
Gamers struggle to find a single, user-friendly platform where they can browse video games, consoles, and accessories, compare across platforms, and make quick purchases. Existing e-commerce sites are either too broad (general online stores) or lack intelligent recommendations.  
Also, our e-commerce website will provide unique statistical data for each game to boost customer satisfaction.

**How the Application should function:**

## 1.2 Proposed Solution
**BitByBit** is an e-commerce application dedicated to gamers. It allows users to:

- Browse games, consoles, and accessories.
- Search by platform (e.g., PlayStation, Nintendo Switch).
- Add products to a cart with instant pop-out preview.
- Checkout after logging in or registering.
- Use a smart chatbot (powered by **LangChain + RAWG API**) for personalized recommendations, live player stats, and ratings.

### Application Design

## 1.3 Target Audience
- **Primary:** Casual and hardcore gamers (ages 15–35) looking for an easy way to discover and buy games and consoles.
- **Secondary:** Parents or gift buyers seeking games or accessories with minimal effort.

# 2. Goals & Success Metrics

## 2.1 Project Goals
- **Usability Goal:** Users should be able to search for a game and add it to the cart in under 30 seconds.
- **Business Goal:** Establish BitByBit as a go-to platform for gaming products and achieve high engagement through chatbot recommendations.
- **Efficiency Goal:** Launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with required features within one semester timeframe.

## 2.2 Success Metrics (KPIs)
- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Target 500+ within the first month of beta.
- **Cart Conversion Rate:** 30% of users who add items to cart should proceed to checkout.
- **User Satisfaction:** Maintain 4.5+ rating in app usability surveys.

# 3. Feature Requirements

## Required Features (Core Functionality – MVP)
- Homepage navigation (Games, Consoles, Accessories).
- Login/Registration.
- Browse by platform (PS4, Switch, etc.).
- Product search (name, category).
- Add to cart (pop-out view with clear/remove options).
- Checkout flow.

## Desired Features (Improves Usability & Appearance)
- Enhanced search filters (price range, genre, release date).
- Clean and responsive UI design (mobile-first).
- Cart saved across sessions (user can log out and return later).
- Sorting options (by popularity, rating, or price).
- Simple “recommended for you” section based on trending games.

## Aspirational Features (Makes the App Stand Out)
- Smart chatbot (**LangChain + RAWG API**) with live stats, reviews, and recommendations.
- Personalized recommendations based on browsing/purchase history.
- Wishlist/Favorites.
- Gamified loyalty points system for frequent buyers.

# 4. Out of Scope
- Offline app mode.
- Multi-language support (future versions only).

---

# 5. Open Questions
- What is the monetization model? (Direct sales only, or commission from third-party sellers?)
- Will payment processing be handled internally or through an external service (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)?
- Should the chatbot provide customer support (order tracking) in addition to game recommendations?
